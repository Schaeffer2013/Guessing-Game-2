# Guessing-Game-2
# This project is a game where one has to guess a number from 0 to 100. The numbers are randomly selected and the player will be notified when the guess is too high, too low, not a valid value, or when the random number is guessed correctly. The player then can play again in the hopes of beating the high score or decide to quit. Hope it is fun!
